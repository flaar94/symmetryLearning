# symmetryLearning

This repository contains the code used in https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01213. It's a bit of a mess, and parts of it, especially the notebooks may have gotten broken when I restructured the project and updated the python 
and package versions. src primarily contains utilities and training algorithms that are used in the experiments and notebooks. The experiments contain the actual testing that is done. Running those will create output data,
often in a data folder
